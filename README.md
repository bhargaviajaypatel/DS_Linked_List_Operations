# DS_Linked_List_Operations

1. Insertion Operation :- Inserting means a new node is added into an already existing node. Before we perform insertion, an OVERFLOW condition must be checked. OVERFLOW condition occurs when AVAIL=NULL or no free memory cell is present in the system. An appropriate message is to be printed if this condition occurs.

2. Deletion Operation :- Deleting a node means how the node is deleted from an already existing linked list. Before we perform deletion, an UNDERFLOW condition must be checked. UNDERFLOW condition occurs when we try to delete an node from a linked list that is empty. This happens when START=NULL or when there are no nodes to delete. We always change the AVAIL pointer so that it points to the address that has been recently vacated.

3. Searching :- Searching a linked list means to find a particular element in the linked list. Searching means finding whether a given is present in the information past of the node or not. If it is present, the algorithm returns the address of the node that contains the value.
